# todoer
Organize your tasks in a tidy way

## This is a very initial version of this tool!

# DO NOT USE IT!

Not everything is mine. I used some code snippets from a few online sources, and I will try to find them and post them soon.

To add immediately
[] Add credits
[] Allow saving tasks in local memory
[] Lots of files are not needed. Delete them and refactor the code.
[] Allow drag and drop between Pending tasks and completed
[] Allow undo
[] fix a problem with a wrong month in the header
[] Automatically add numbering
[] something is not very right in the header (margins, padding). Fix it.
[] Is greyed background needed?
